## Project Overview
The project that our group undertook was given to us by LivableStreets Alliance, who
work to create a better living space and environment for people living in the Boston area. The
main goal of this project is to connect open spaces, infrastructure, and displacement
meaningfully through data analysis. This type of project should ideally find out what type of
relationship, if any, marked bus lanes, parks, and greenways have with relation to displacement
in the zones they are located. Our group focused specifically on greenways/parks.

## Project Structure
The project is broken down into three deliverables: 
* Early Insights
* Mid Semester 
* Final Deliverable <br>

These can be found in the deliverables directory. <br>
Each sub-directory will contain the datasets used as well as the notebooks used to pre-process the data and create the graphs. 
The Early Insights sub-directory contains the datasets used, the notebook used, presentation, and report.
The mid-semester sub-directory contains the datasets used, the notebook used to generate the graphs for the mid-semester deliverable (data.ipynb), and a sub-directory named Housing for analysis of housing prices. The rest are duplicates from early insights.
The final-deliverable sub-directory contains the datasets used, the notebook used, and final report.

## Recommended Next Steps: 
Looking into the future of this study, there are many different possible areas to look into
and many extensions that would reinforce our research findings. One problem we faced relating
to greenways was the fact that many neighborhoods did not have any of them at all. Hopefully if
more analysis is done in the future relating to greenways, there exists greenways in more Boston
neighborhoods. Another possible direction for this study is more qualitative analysis via focus groups and
interviews with residents/community leaders who live near or are potentially affected by
greenways and the potential gentrification of the area.
