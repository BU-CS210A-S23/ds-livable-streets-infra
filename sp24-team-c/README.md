## Livable Streets Introduction

LivableStreets Alliance is a non-profit organization based in the Metro Boston area that seeks to transform streets into safe and accessible public spaces connecting people and the places they frequent. The group explores the effectiveness of different transportation solutions, with an emphasis on convenience and accessibility. These solutions often manifest themselves as bike lanes, open spaces, and other public amenities that promote sustainability in urban areas. Our group was tasked with quantifying the extent of displacement inflicted on local communities by new and existing transportation infrastructure.

## Project Structure

The deliverables section is broken into three sub-directories:

- early-insights
- mid-semester
- final-project

Each sub-directory contains sub-directories devoted to each question we tried to answer. For example, mid-semester is broken into four questions:

- bikelane-applied-mid-semester
- bus-mid-semester-proposal
- green-line-mid-semester
- income-mid-semester

The other sub-directories of final-project and early-insights have a similar structure. Every question sub-directory contains the relevant notebooks and images. There is a corresponding directory under /data containing all the CSVs pertinent to each question sub-directory. Please feel free to let us know if we can clarify anything.

## Datasets

Below are the datasets used for each key question. See the notebooks in the directory themselves for more in-depth information.
