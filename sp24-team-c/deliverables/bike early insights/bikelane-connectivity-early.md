# Bike Lane Connectivity - Early Insights

## Bike Lanes Are Helpful
We know that building more bike lanes increases bicycle traffic and decreases car traffic congestion – this idea is not new. It's why more and more urban areas are proposing and acting on requests for more bike lanes. In metro areas, where the population is dense and space is limited, bikes alongside public transit make much more sense than personal vehicles.

But there is a subset of this idea that is less common, and it’s about the connectedness of said bike lanes. After all, building a bike lane means a lot less when it’s not connected to other bike lanes or places a person would want to be. Boston's local government seems to be aware of this issue, as they have active plans to try to better connect existing bike lanes in their Better Bike Lanes initiative. We still, however, would like to see tangible evidence of bike connectivity correlations with bike commuting and displacement data, and the extent of which they are related. 

This early insight seeks to find trends in bike commute rates in areas with good bike infrastructure and connected bike lanes compared to those with similar-quality bike infrastructure but with less connectivity with Boston’s main bike network.

## Methodology of Early Insight
*Disclaimer: We have NOT ran data through any algorithms or code for this portion of the early insight. All observations were made manually. This is set to change in the future.*

To conduct these observations, we took census tracts of areas with various amounts of bike infrastructure, and used data from the US Census Bureau to find information about the residents of these areas to compare with each other. This early insight will primarily focus on the Suffolk County.

## Control Group: Suffolk County

As a whole, only 1.8% of all residents surveyed from the Suffolk County are bicycle commuters. We will be using this data point as a baseline for the following areas observed. This could be caused by a myriad of factors:
- Lack of inadequate cycling infrastructure in certain areas
- Distance of commute to workplace being too short or long for cycling
- Convenience of public transit outweighs cycling 
- Likewise, inconvenience of cycling encourages usage of personal vehicles
- And the one we want to observe: **Poor connectivity of Bike Lanes in Bike Network**
