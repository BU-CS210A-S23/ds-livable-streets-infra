## What is the project focus/overall goal?

We are looking for general correlations between public and civil infrastructure and displacement. We are looking for trends in the data that might shed insights on the correlations to better inform policymakers.

## Why is this project important?

Its important to reduce the tradeoff between displacement and public infrastructure. Ideally we hope to support public infrastructure that minimizes current displacement. Public infrastructure helps minimze transit times, car emissions, and increases accessibility, yet these benefits should not come at the expense of local residents.

## What type of data will you be collecting or analyzing

- Transit times on routes
- Changes in population by race and ethnicity
- Locations of current infrastructure
- Ridership numbers on different routes

## What are potential limiations of the project

The correlation may not exist, or might already be intuitive public knowledge that is not being acted upon. Trends may shift over time, or be difficult to act upon. Our findings must be taken within the context of budgetary and feasibility constraints.

## What are your next steps?

- Finding correlations between displacement and train spots (William, Jacob)
- Finding correlations between displacements and other forms of transportation (Marco, Nyx)
- Narrow down our points of focus
